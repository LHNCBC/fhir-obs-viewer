# FHIR Research Data Finder

This is a query tool that allows you search a FHIR serverâ€™s resources to select
a cohort of patients, and then pull data for those patients.

## Demo
Try it out on the [demo page](https://lhcforms.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/research-data-finder/).

## How to run it locally

2. Run app in development mode (locally):
